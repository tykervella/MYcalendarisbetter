## USAGE

This application displays the day at the top of the page. 

There are time blocks to display the different hours between 7am and 5pm. The application allows for user input by clicking on the desired time block and typing a description of what they would like to accomplish in that time. The user can then save this input to local storage by pressing the "save" button to the right of the timeblock. 

Any saved input will be displayed on the calendar upon loading the page.
